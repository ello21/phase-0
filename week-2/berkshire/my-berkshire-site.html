<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
   + It was great practice to break the down HTML elements of the pages and try to recreate them.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
   + I appreciated that there were multiple choices to accomplish the same end goal. For example, I could have used <div id = "section"> but wanted to try out the newer HTML5 tags so I used <section> instead.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
   + I definitely had to keep making choices about which parts of the page's structure I should recreate with HTML vs. waiting and defining the attributes in CSS. I was mindful of the need to separate semantics from styling.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
   + HTML has everything needed to create a solid page structure. The bad comes in when developers use it in ways it's not meant to be used. For example, styling. This causes the page to render incorrectly on differently platforms and makes a huge mess for the developer that has to maintain it years later.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
   + I always make my open and close tags at the same time. Prevents me from forgetting to do it later, saves debugging time, and makes nesting easier to see along the way.

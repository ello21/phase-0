		<h2>Version Control for Bosses</h2>

        <b><i>Picture this</i></b>: You're on a team of 3 boss-level developers in the midst of a caffeine-inspired-all-nighter to get your STATUS-QUO-DISRUPTING app deployed to the Google Play Store by the next morning. Does the app work? Yes. Are all who look upon it driven to tears? Hardly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your goal for the night was just to add that final design touch to take your app from basic to "BALLINNNNNN!"...and your dreams of breaking the internet were well within your reach...until...James broke the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        No problem, git to the rescue!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh...you DIDN'T use version control because it "slowed you down"? You thought git was for "noobs"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the rest of this post is for those of us who <b>won't</b> be picking up the broken pieces of our lives for the next week.
      </p>

        Version control is what gives developers the flexibility to experiment and break stuff without fear. Any good version control system will save and track changes to a project over time, so that <i>when</i> a faulty piece of code is introduced, the team can revert back to a previous working version of the project and continue on their road to stardom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is a version control system with some particularly useful features. One is that each team member can have a seperate but complete version of the project on their local computer, in addition to a central repository that the team may host on a remote server or cloud, such as GitHub. Having this distributed workflow provides a safety net for times when local computers crash. The entire project's codebase will be safely hosted in the cloud and can be accessed from any computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Git workflow includes steps to create a local repo, add files it, and then begin tracking and "committing" changes made to those files. At any time, a user can revert back to previous file versions, or, once changes are final, the user can "push" those changes into the team's master repo. An added feature that GitHub provides is the "Pull Request" which makes it easy for other team members to review code before it's "pulled" into the master project files.
      </p>
      <p>
      All these features make Git and GitHub not just useful, but necessary, for any development team. Noobs and bosses alike.

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
- I used <article> in this challenge because it's the most specific and appropriate for a blog post. I normally use <header> and <section> are 2 tags I use frequently to give my pages structure. I could use <divs> as well but since they don't have any semantic meaning I prefer section, header, footer, etc.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
- The file extension .html tells the browser to interpret the code inside the file using html standards. The browser reads the file from top to bottom and when there are nested elements they are displayed within their parent element.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
- I hadn't used the snippet shortcut before! I will definitely define a few others for myself. I've been using shortcuts like ctrl+D to find/change multiple occurences of a character, and ctrl+[] to indent multiple lines. I'm always looking for more and will continue researching them.
